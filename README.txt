This is a simple calculator written in python.

I used tkinter.

calculator.py is the calculator.

progress-bar.py is just a cool progress bar in the terminal.
calculator-terminal.py is a simple calculator in the terminal and it loads using the progress bar when you calculate something or enter/exit the program.
